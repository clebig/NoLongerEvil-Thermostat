NoLongerEvil contain this statment:
"Open Source Commitment
We are committed to transparency and the right-to-repair movement. The firmware
 images and backend API server code will be open sourced soon, allowing the 
community to audit, improve, and self-host their own infrastructure."

In the meantime, I am providing these files extracted from the NoLongerEvil's 
firmware so that users can understand how the firmware is built and how it works.


The ./bin/nolongerevil script in this directory is is used to make the 
necessary changes to the original firmware to redirect all the traffic 
originally exchanged with Google's servers to one ip pointing to 
nolongerevil.com. 

To achieve this, a custom CA is provided so TLS exchanges with nolongerevil's 
backend IP using the original nest.com/google.com domains are considered 
secured. Original Nest and Google domains are declared in the hosts file
all pointing the nolongerevil's backend server.

However, the A DNS record for nolongerevil.com is pointing toward cloudflare,
so if you resolve it against public DNS, you will be directed to the site 
through cloudflare.

./etc and ./bin contain files that are used to make the NoLongerEvil mod from 
an image of the original firmware.

I voluntarly removed the firmware's binaries from this fork, if you need them, 
please go to the original project:

A big thank you to Cody Kociemba @codykociemba for this great initiative!
